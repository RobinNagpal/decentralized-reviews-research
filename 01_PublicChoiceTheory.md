Other theories related to public choice theory include:

1. Game Theory: Often used in public choice analysis, game theory helps to model the strategic interactions between individuals in political processes, predicting the outcomes of these interactions.

2. Principal-Agent Theory: This explores the difficulties in motivating one party (the agent, such as a politician or bureaucrat) to act in the best interest of another (the principal, such as voters or the general public) when interests conflict and information is asymmetric.

3. Social Choice Theory: Closely related to public choice, it deals with aggregating individual preferences into collective decisions, exploring how different voting rules and procedures affect the outcome of collective decision-making.

4. Constitutional Economics: A subfield of public choice theory that analyzes the constitutional rules, enforcement, and design of institutions to understand how they influence the behavior of political and economic agents and affect economic and political outcomes.

5. Behavioral Economics: While public choice traditionally assumes rational behavior, behavioral economics incorporates insights from psychology to explore deviations from rationality in economic and political decisions, such as biases and heuristics.
